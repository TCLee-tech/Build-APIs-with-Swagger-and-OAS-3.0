# Build-APIs-with-Swagger-and-OAS-3.0
Building APIs using OpenAPI Specification 3.0. Using Swagger Hub. Exporting client SDK and server stub, Integrate client SDK into Angular app. Implement server-side API, host and run API on cloud. Use API proxy.
<br>

### Document List

- Build Swagger APIs and OAS 3.docx - Instructions notes
- Notes.txt - some possible changes to pom.xml. Java 8 for this repo. Java upgrade will break codes with deprecated elements.
- Angular client app screengrabs:
  * Angular client app-rest-api-product service typescript file - product.service.ts is part of client SDK auto-generated by Swagger Hub. Codes to call API for different paths and operations.
  * Angular app component typescript file - app.component.ts put together app components. Imports product.service.ts from Swagger client SDK.
  * Angular app running locally in Visual Studio Code - proof of successful running of Angular app after import of client SDK into Angular frame.
  * Screengrab of angular app on localhost 4200 - proof of work. No image as none hosted on Swagger virtual hub.


<br>
- yaml files

  * blogPostAPI.yaml - API definition to POST to blog, based on OpenAPI specification 3.0
  
  * openapi.yaml - exercise on OAS 3.0. Includes GET and POST operations. Sample use of definitions, componenets, security.
  
  * simpleAPI.yaml - the initial basic learning of OAS 3.0
  
  * LearnSwaggerSG7-h-plus_blog_api-2.0.0-resolved.yaml - learning how to GET different elements of articles, listing them under properties of components 

<br>
- Server-side API implementation gcreengrabs:

  * Localhost server stub API implementation to GET products - shows successful call of API using localhost.
  * local machine running server stub API implementation - proof of successful Spring initialization using server stub from Swagger Hub.
