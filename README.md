# Build-APIs-with-Swagger-and-OAS-3.0
Design-driven development.

#### Checkpoints
1. Define consumer and server interaction via REST APIs. 
    - standardization using OpenAPI Specification 3.0.
    - decide on paths, operations, securitySchemes, requestBodies, responseBodies, httpStatus to cover etc

2. How to use Swagger Hub. 
    - Exporting client SDK and server stub.

3. Integrate client SDK into Angular application. 

4. Implement server-side API
    - host and run Java machine on cloud. 
    - Use API proxy.

### Document List

- [Notes on building APIs with Swagger and OAS 3](https://github.com/TCLee-tech/Build-APIs-with-Swagger-and-OAS-3.0/blob/d9db876b4e4b4ed7b18d74de9b60e031271667f5/Build%20Swagger%20APIs%20and%20OAS%203.docx)
- The server stub for Spring from SwaggerHub was based on Java 7 (version correct as of my trial. Upgrading Java to use version 17 (current Long-Term Support version) resulted in broken codes with multiple deprecated elements. Issue reflected to Swagger. JIRA raised. Nothing happened. Some possible changes to pom.xml are recorded in [Notes.txt](https://github.com/TCLee-tech/Build-APIs-with-Swagger-and-OAS-3.0/blob/df05b72fc445bd32174b508655828d64596acc76/Notes.txt).

- Below is a list of yaml files, in increasing order of difficulty, built using the Swagger Editor, to OpenAPI 3.0 Specification.
   * [simpleAPI.yaml](https://github.com/TCLee-tech/Build-APIs-with-Swagger-and-OAS-3.0/blob/aa2044b5bf5a0e1cdef0b04849aa14129aa5e161/simpleAPI.yaml)
     * intro to document structure of OAS 3.0
   * [LearnSwaggerSG7-h-plus_blog_api-2.0.0-resolved.yaml](https://github.com/TCLee-tech/Build-APIs-with-Swagger-and-OAS-3.0/blob/aa2044b5bf5a0e1cdef0b04849aa14129aa5e161/LearnSwaggerSG7-h-plus_blog_api-2.0.0-resolved.yaml)
     * how to GET different elements of articles
     * new: put document Objects under components for reusability 
   * [blogPostAPI.yaml](https://github.com/TCLee-tech/Build-APIs-with-Swagger-and-OAS-3.0/blob/aa2044b5bf5a0e1cdef0b04849aa14129aa5e161/blogPostAPI.yaml)
     * how to POST a blog article
     * new: reuse of schemas under component for requestBody and responseBody
   * [openapi.yaml](https://github.com/TCLee-tech/Build-APIs-with-Swagger-and-OAS-3.0/blob/aa2044b5bf5a0e1cdef0b04849aa14129aa5e161/openapi.yaml)
     * a more complete example
     * includes GET and POST operations.
     * different httpStatus codes for responseBodies 
     * new: use of parameters, schemas, securitySchemes under component.

- Below is a list of screengrabs from Angular client app to show what you should be looking at:
  * [Angular client app-rest-api-product service typescript file](https://github.com/TCLee-tech/Build-APIs-with-Swagger-and-OAS-3.0/blob/aa2044b5bf5a0e1cdef0b04849aa14129aa5e161/Angular%20client%20app-rest-api-product%20service%20typescript%20file.jpg)
    * product.service.ts is part of client SDK auto-generated by Swagger Hub. 
    * contains codes to call API for different paths and operations.
  * [Angular app component typescript file](https://github.com/TCLee-tech/Build-APIs-with-Swagger-and-OAS-3.0/blob/aa2044b5bf5a0e1cdef0b04849aa14129aa5e161/Angular%20app%20component%20typescript%20file.jpg)
    * app.component.ts put together components for Angular application. 
    * It imports product.service.ts from Swagger client SDK.
  * [Angular app running locally in Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/TCLee-tech/Build-APIs-with-Swagger-and-OAS-3.0/blob/aa2044b5bf5a0e1cdef0b04849aa14129aa5e161/Angular%20app%20running%20locally%20in%20Visual%20Studio%20Code.jpg)
    * what you should see with successful running of Angular application locally after import of client SDK into Angular frame.
  * [Screengrab of angular app on localhost 4200](https://github.com/TCLee-tech/Build-APIs-with-Swagger-and-OAS-3.0/blob/aa2044b5bf5a0e1cdef0b04849aa14129aa5e161/Screengrab%20of%20angular%20app%20on%20localhost%204200.jpg)
    * what you should see on webpage served by angular app. 
    * Swagger virtual hub does not store images, so no images will display when Swagger virtual hub is used for testing.

- Server-side API implementation screengrabs:

  * ProductService java file with additional codes to build out server side API implementation
    * The java file with service layer code to call ProductAPIcontroller.java which is from Swagger Hub server stub
    * The only extra java file on server side
  * Localhost server stub API implementation to GET products 
    * shows successful running on localhost.
  * local machine running server stub API implementation 
    * shows successful Java Spring Boot initialization in Visual Studio Code using server stub from Swagger Hub.
  * Azure Vm for Swagger API
    * shows successful deployment of VM on Microsoft Azure that hosts API server
  * Azure Vm for Swagger API 2
    * shows details of deployed VM 

- API proxy
  * Google Apigee Edge, AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management, IBM API Connect
  * Link to integration guide on swagger.io and in "instructions notes".
